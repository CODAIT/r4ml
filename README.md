 - <span style="color:green"> Created on top of Apache SparkR and SystemML (so it supports features from both </span>
 - <span style="color:green"> Act as the R bridge between SparkR and SystemML. </span>
 - <span style="color:green"> Provides a collection of canned algorithms. </span>
 - <span style="color:green"> Ability to create custom ML algorithm. </span>
 - <span style="color:green"> User gets both SparkR and R4ML functionality </span>
 - <span style="color:green"> APIs are more friendlier to the R user. </span>

## __**How to install**__
  
  R4ML installation involves, it's dependencies (R and SparkR) installation.
  Detail instructin is provided at [R4ML Installation](./docs/r4ml-install.md).

## __**How to Use R4ML**__

  Once you have installed R4ML, it is time to use it for scalable machine learning and 
  data analysis. Look at the section on [R4ML Examples](./docs/r4ml-examples.md).

## __**R4ML apis**__

 
 After you follow the instruction at 'How to install', you can point your browser to 
 ```
 $R4ML_INSTALLED_LOCATION/R4ML/R4ML/html/00Index.html .
 ```

 For example, if you have installed in the /home/data-scientist/sparktc then open a 
 web browser and type in the following in the url

 ```
 file:///home/data-scientist/sparktc/R4ML/R4ML/html/00Index.html
