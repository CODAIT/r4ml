# This scripts packages the HydraR source files (R and C files) and
# creates a package that can be loaded in R. The package is by default installed to
# $FWDIR/lib and the package can be loaded by using the following command in R:
#
#   library(HydraR, lib.loc="$FWDIR/lib")
#
# NOTE(shivaram): Right now we use $SPARK_HOME/R/lib to be the installation directory
# to load the SparkR package on the worker nodes.
