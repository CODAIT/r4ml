## Introduction
R4ML supports all the standard R datatypes but for the bigdata, we supports three data types

- SparkR::DataFrame
- r4ml.frame
- r4ml.matrix

## Details of the data types

### SparkR::DataFrame.
  More information is here for [creating SparkR::DataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html#creating-dataframes) and [SparkR::DataFrame operations](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html#dataframe-operations)

### r4ml.frame
  This is based on SparkR::DataFrame but supports extra functionalities. They are
   - 
   - 
  
### r4ml.matrix
  This is based on r4ml.frame with extra requirement that all the entries must be numeric. Extra functionalities allows it to interface with the [system ML DML ](http://apache.github.io/incubator-systemml/dml-language-reference.html)
