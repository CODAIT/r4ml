HydraR is the distributed R with the following goals and mission

- Work on the `big data`
- Support common `Machine Learning` algorithms
- Support the various commons `Statistical` and `dataframe` functionality with look and feel as much as close to the base and stats R packages
- Support for the ability to run CRAN R packages over the distributed `dataframe`


The HydraR is build on the top of the [Apache SparkR]() ( [Spark]()) and [Apache SystemML]() . This allows HydraR user to use

- All the SparkR capabilities
- All the SystemML custom Machine learning algorithms
- Extra features supported by [HydraR]()
